            <p>
                Key Club International is the oldest and largest service program for high school students.
                This international organization is led by students who learn leadership through their service.
                Key Club International is sponsored by Kiwanis International, and is currently assisting Kiwanis in helping the children of the world.
                Right now, there are over 260,000 members from 5,000 clubs from 34 nations. In 1925, the first Key Club was established in  Sacramento,
                California by the local Kiwanis club. Two men from Kiwanis proposed the idea of having a "junior service program," and first opened it to
                the "key" boys of the school (who wanted to serve the school in any way possible and create more school spirit). Thus, Kiwanis dubbed
                this organization "Key Club."

            <h1>What is Kiwanis?</h1>
            <p>
                Kiwanis International is an organization dedicated to change the world. They feed the hungry, help shelter the homeless,
                mentor the disadvantaged, teacher students how to become leaders and help in their community, raise money for research
                for pediatrics, and make a substantial difference. The Key Club service initiative is the hands-on element of the Major Emphasis.
                All of the hands-on service provided to children by Key Club International members is directed to a single area of need, to make a
                substantial impact. The current service initiative, The Eliminate Project, allows Key Clubbers joining forces with Kiwanis International
                and UNICEF eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus.

            <h1>About EWHS Key Club</h1>
            <p>
                EWHS Key Club is one of the twelve schools that make up Division 21. Division 21 is one of the 44 divisions within the PNW District.
                We meet every week on Tuesdays at 7PM which lasts for about an hour. Edmonds-Woodway Key Club is involved in many neighboring organizations
                including Annie’s Kitchen, March of Dimes, and KCCP. A service event unique to our Key Club is making pumpkin pies for the homeless during
                the holiday season. It’s a fun way to bring our members together as well as give back to our community. For more updates on events going on in
                our division, join the Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/pnwdivision21/">"PNW Division 21 Key Club."</a>
