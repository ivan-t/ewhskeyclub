                This international organization is led by students who learn leadership through their service.

            <h1>Why is it called Key Club?</h1>
            <p>
                In 1925, the first Key Club was established in  Sacramento, California by the local Kiwanis club.
                Two men from Kiwanis proposed the idea of having a "junior service program," and first opened it to
                the "key" boys of the school (who wanted to serve the school in any way possible and create more school spirit).
                Thus, Kiwanis dubbed this organization "Key Club."
