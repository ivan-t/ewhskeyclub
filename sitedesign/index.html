            <p>
                Key Club International is the oldest and largest service program for high school students.
                This international organization is led by students who learn leadership through their service.
                Key Club International is sponsored by Kiwanis International, and is currently assisting Kiwanis in helping the children of the world.
                Right now, there are over 260,000 members from 5,000 clubs from 34 nations.

            <h2>Why is it called Key Club?</h2>
            <p>
                In 1925, the first Key Club was established in  Sacramento, California by the local Kiwanis club.
                Two men from Kiwanis proposed the idea of having a "junior service program," and first opened it to
                the "key" boys of the school (who wanted to serve the school in any way possible and create more school spirit).
                Thus, Kiwanis dubbed this organization "Key Club."

                mentor the disadvantaged, teacher students how to become leaders and help in their community, raise money for research
                for pediatrics, and make a substantial difference.

                    March of Dimes improves the health of babies by preventing birth defects, premature birth, and infant mortality.
                    For decades, Key Club members raised thousands of dollars annually through various programs, including collecting change,
