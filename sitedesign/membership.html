                    You can earn service/CAS hours, make new friends, and go to district conventions filled with other enthusiastic students.
                    Being passionate and actively involved about Key Club impresses colleges and earns you scholarships.
                    By making a difference in other people's lives, Key Club members build both their character and leadership skills. Key Club also
                    helps in developing important Social and Emotional Skills, which allows club members to understand self and develop meaningful
                    connections with others. Club members learn to calm down when angry, initiate meaningful friendships, resolve relationship conflicts
                    respectfully, and make ethical and safe choices.
